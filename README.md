## Running with Docker

This application can be easily run using Docker. Ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1.  Navigate to the project root directory in your terminal.
2.  Run the following command to build and start the application and the database:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

    This command will:
    * `--build`: Build the Docker images if they haven't been built yet or if there are changes in your `Dockerfile` or `docker-compose.yml`.
    * `up`: Create and start the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml`.
    * `-d`: Run the containers in detached mode (in the background).

3.  Once the containers are running, the application should be accessible at [mention the URL where your React app is served, e.g., `http://localhost:3000` if that's the port exposed in your Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml`].

## Stopping the Docker Containers

To stop the application and database, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose down
